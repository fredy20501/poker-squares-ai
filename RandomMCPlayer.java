/**
 * RandomMCPlayer - a simple Monte Carlo implementation of the player interface for PokerSquares.
 * For each possible play, continues play with random possible card draws and random card placements to a given depth limit
 * (or game end).  Having sampled trajectories for all possible plays, the RandomMCPlayer then selects the
 * play yielding the best average scoring potential in such Monte Carlo simulation.
 *
 * Disclaimer: This example code is not intended as a model of efficiency. (E.g., patterns from Knuth's Dancing Links
 * algorithm (DLX) can provide faster legal move list iteration/deletion/restoration.)  Rather, this example
 * code illustrates how a player could be constructed.  Note how time is simply managed so as to not run out the play clock.
